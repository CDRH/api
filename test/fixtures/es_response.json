Cather’s sister-in-law. Meta Schaper was born in Plattsmouth, NE, the second daughter of Robert and Julia Ramke Schaper. After graduating from the University of Nebraska in Lincoln 1903, Meta Schaper taught at Havelock High School in her hometown of Havelock, NE (now part of Lincoln). She met Roscoe Cather when teaching in Fullerton, NE, and they married in 1907. They moved to Lander, WY, in 1909, where she gave birth to three daughters, Virginia and twins Margaret and Elizabeth. The family moved to Casper, WY, in 1921 and Colusa, CA, in 1937. Willa visited Meta and Roscoe’s family in Wyoming several times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926 trip to New Mexico with Meta, Roscoe, and their children and a 1941 San Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. Meta and Willa remained friends until Willa’s death.Roscoe CatherRoscoe and Meta Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Roscoe (1877-1945) (“Ross”). Cather’s brother. Roscoe was born in Virginia, the second child and oldest son of Charles and Virginia Cather. After graduating from Red Cloud (NE) High School in 1895, he taught country school for two years, attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln for one year (1897-1898), taught high school in Carlton, NE, and Oxford, NE, and finally became superintendent of schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an abstract office and where their three children, Virginia and twins Margaret and Elizabeth, were born. In 1921, they moved to Casper, WY, where Roscoe became president of the Wyoming Trust Company, and in 1937 to Colusa, CA, where Roscoe and his brother Douglass had acquired a controlling interest in the First Savings Bank of Colusa. Roscoe served as president of the bank until his death. Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926 trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle family-related business as well as personal financial matters, and he was one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932).Studio portrait of Meta Schaper Cather around the year 1900Roscoe and Meta Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Meta Schaper (1884-1973).

Born in Lander, WY, to Roscoe Cather and Meta Schaper Cather, Virginia graduated from Natrona County High School in Casper, WY, in 1929. She received an A.B. in English from Smith College in Northampton, MA, in 1933, the same year Willa Cather received an honorary doctorate there. In 1934, she enrolled in the University of Chicago School of Social Services and was, for a time, a social worker. She married John Hadley Brockway, a Navy officer, in 1936. They moved frequently until his retirement from the Navy. She had one child, son George. In letters, Willa Cather sometimes calls her \"West Virginia\" to distinguish her from her cousin Mary Virginia Auld because Virginia Cather's birthplace in Wyoming was farther west than Mary Virginia's in Nebraska.Portrait of Charles Douglas CatherNebraska State Historical Society Cather, Charles Douglas (1880-1938) (“Douglass”). Cather’s brother. Born in Virginia and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Charles was third child and second son of Charles and Virginia Cather. As an adolescent, Douglass Cather helped his father supervise rented farm properties and worked as a messenger for the local Burlington & Missouri Railroad office. In 1897 he left Red Cloud for a position in Sterling, CO, and then took a position with at the Cheyenne, WY, office of the Burlington Railroad. In 1908 he traveled to Mexico, an experience that his sister gave to Emil Bergson in O Pioneers! (1913). By 1910 he was living in Winslow, AZ, still working for the Burlington, where Willa Cather visited him in 1912. He later achieved success in the oil business in California. Although he never married, Cather notes that during the last six or seven years of his life he had a relationship with a Miss Rogers. Douglass visited Cather in New York City in December of 1937. His death in June 1938 left her devastated. Douglass served as a prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932) and Hector the messenger boy brother in “The Best Years” (1948). His years working for the Burlington also inspired Cather’s many railroad worker characters in her novels, including Song of the Lark (1915) and The Professor’s House (1925). Few letters from this important sibling relationship have survived.",

I am afraid they will be a little large, but if they are the babies will soon grow to them. The black shoes were all much too ugly to send to cunning babies. I got some cleaning stuff to keep these white. When they get very dirty you can wash them with soap and cold water and then rub this birch powder in after they dry. I met Mrs. Goodwin at the hotel in Casper. We had dinner together and she walked to the train with me and told me most of the secrets of her life, and how she desires to write a novel about the sun-dance, with \"a light love theme woven in\"! Miss Ross, it seems, is preparing to write an Indian novel and is stealing copy off the poor devils all the while she pretends to be saving their souls. Douglass is looking better than he has for a long time, and seems to be in good spirits. We go on to Red Cloud tonight. Now I am going to \"Prof. J.T. Ryan\" for a shampoo. Please hug the babies for me, and tell them I hope their little shoes will be comfy. With a great deal of love to you all Willa"

          "annotations" : "Southwick, Helen Louise Cather (1918-2004). Cather’s niece. Helen was born in Red Cloud, NE, to Willa Cather’s brother James and his wife Ethel. Willa was a doting aunt on her visits to Red Cloud. In 1931, Helen moved with her family to Long Beach, CA, where she graduated high school and attended Long Beach City College. In 1939, Helen returned to Red Cloud to help care for her maternal grandmother and then enrolled in the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, where she met her future husband, Philip Southwick. After graduating in 1941, she briefly returned to California to work in the personnel department of Douglas Aircraft company, but married Southwick in Lincoln in 1942, and then moved with him to Champagne, IL. When Philip’s employment took them to Plainfield, NJ, she frequently spent time with her aunt in New York City. In 1946, the Southwicks moved to Pittsburgh, PA, where their son James was born. In later years Helen worked as a school librarian and was active in the Cather Foundation in Red Cloud, NE. She was a beneficiary of Cather’s literary estate, and when Edith Lewis died in 1972 she bequeathed Cather books and manuscripts to Helen and her brother Charles Cather. Helen donated her share of these materials and Willa Cather’s letters to her to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.Southwick, Helen Louise Cather (1918-2004). Cather’s niece. Helen was born in Red Cloud, NE, to Willa Cather’s brother James and his wife Ethel. Willa was a doting aunt on her visits to Red Cloud. In 1931, Helen moved with her family to Long Beach, CA, where she graduated high school and attended Long Beach City College. In 1939, Helen returned to Red Cloud to help care for her maternal grandmother and then enrolled in the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, where she met her future husband, Philip Southwick. After graduating in 1941, she briefly returned to California to work in the personnel department of Douglas Aircraft company, but married Southwick in Lincoln in 1942, and then moved with him to Champagne, IL.

Helen donated her share of these materials and Willa Cather’s letters to her to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.Cather, Charles Edwin (1923-2011). Cather’s nephew. Charles’s parents were James D. and Ethel Garber Cather, and he was likely born in Red Cloud, NE, where he spent the early years of his childhood. He was, as Willa Cather wrote to Dorothy Canfield Fisher, “the little nephew I love the best” who inspired her portrayal of the little boy Jacques in Shadows on the Rock (1931) (#1054). He moved with his family to California in the 1930s. Cather continued to be an indulgent aunt as he got older, writing him letters of advice about and lending him money for his education. He attended, but did not complete degrees from, the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, the United States Military Academy in West Point, NY, and the Law School at the University of Colorado in Boulder. After his aunt’s death he completed undergraduate and law degrees at Stanford University, in Palo Alto, CA. He was a beneficiary of his aunt’s estate and was appointed her literary executor after Edith Lewis’s death.Cather, James Donald (1886-1966) (“Jim”). Cather’s brother. James was born in Red Cloud, NE, the fifth child and third son of Charles and Virginia Cather. James moved to Wyoming in 1907 to work with his brothers Douglass and Roscoe. In 1913 he married Ethel Garber, and owned and operated clothing stores first in Red Cloud and then Holyoke, CO, where the family settled for a time 1920 before returning to Red Cloud in 1922. The couple had two children, Helen Louise and Charles Edwin. In 1930 the family moved to California so James could work in the oil business with Douglass and his partners. Willa’s relationship with James was more distant than that with her brothers Douglass and Roscoe, who were closer to her own age, although she was very fond of his children.Cather, Ethel Garber (1889-1975). Cather’s sister-in-law. Ethel was the daughter of Edwin S. Garber and through him was related to Governor Silas Garber, the model for Captain Forrester in A Lost Lady (1923). Ethel graduated from the University of Nebraska in Lincoln in 1909 and married James Cather in 1913. The couple had two children, Helen Louise and Charles Edwin. The family moved to California in 1930. Ethel and Willa Cather were not close.",

There are so many things I want to thank you for! The lovely iris and jonquils you bought me from you and Charles outlived and out-shone many other flowers because you brought them in from the country, whereas flowers ordered from a New York florist go through the middlemen before they reach the shop. A fine bottle of cologne water came from Jim and Ethel, but I think you must have selected it. Please thank them—I will write them when I ean can. This is the first time I have taken up a pen, and my hand is still a bit crabbed. No wonder you have had influenza—was there ever such devilish weather! Oh yes, the operation turned out very well—there was nothing ugly or alarming in the bump. Surger is rather exhausting, however. Lovingly Your Aunt Willa"

Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Lewis, Edith Labaree (1881-1972). Magazine editor, advertising copywriter, and Cather's domestic partner. Born in Lincoln, NE, to Henry Euclid Lewis and Lillie Gould Lewis, Edith Lewis attended the preparatory school associated with the University of Nebraska, earning college credits from the University before transferring to Smith College in Northampton, MA, in 1899. She received an A.B. in English from Smith in 1902 and returned home to teach elementary school. She met Willa Cather in the summer of 1903 at the home of Sarah Harris, publisher of the Lincoln Courier. Moving to New York City soon afterward, Lewis settled into a studio on Washington Square and found work at the Century Publishing Company. Cather was her guest when she visited the city from Pittsburgh. In 1906, at Cather's suggestion, Lewis applied for a position as an editorial proofreader at McClure's Magazine, and the two women worked together on the McClure's staff for six years. In 1908, they moved into a shared apartment at 82 Washington Place, and then, in 1912, to Five Bank Street. Lewis left McClure's in 1915 to become managing editor of Every Week Magazine, where she stayed until the magazine folded in 1918. In 1919 she began a long career as an advertising copywriter at the J. Walter Thompson Co. In 1926 Edith Lewis acquired the land on which she and Cather built their cottage on Grand Manan Island. When they lost their apartment on Bank Street to subway construction in 1927, they shared quarters at the Grosvenor Hotel when they were both in New York City. In 1932 they took an apartment at 570 Park Avenue. Throughout their relationship, Lewis was closely involved in Cather's creative process, reading and editing her work in pre-publication forms. Cather's will appointed Lewis as executor of her literary estate and a beneficiary of her literary trust. Lewis authorized E.K. Brown as Cather's first biographer and published her own memoir of Cather, Willa Cather Living (1953). She remained in their Park Avenue apartment after Cather's death and died there after a long period of illness and invalidism. She is buried at Cather's side in Jaffrey, NH.No annotation is availableNo annotation is availableNo annotation is availableRoscoe CatherRoscoe and Meta Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Roscoe (1877-1945) (“Ross”). Cather’s brother. Roscoe was born in Virginia, the second child and oldest son of Charles and Virginia Cather. After graduating from Red Cloud (NE) High School in 1895, he taught country school for two years, attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln for one year (1897-1898), taught high school in Carlton, NE, and Oxford, NE, and finally became superintendent of schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an abstract office and where their three children, Virginia and twins Margaret and Elizabeth, were born. In 1921, they moved to Casper, WY, where Roscoe became president of the Wyoming Trust Company, and in 1937 to Colusa, CA, where Roscoe and his brother Douglass had acquired a controlling interest in the First Savings Bank of Colusa. Roscoe served as president of the bank until his death. Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926 trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle family-related business as well as personal financial matters, and he was one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932).Studio portrait of Meta Schaper Cather around the year 1900Roscoe and Meta Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Meta Schaper (1884-1973).

Last week the moon rose further and further north every night, first over the tip of fishhead, and finally right in front of our door—came up out of the water like a battered old copper kettle as it grew more and more lop–sided. It made such a bright, narrow path right to the foot of our cliff that one was tempted to walk across it. The weather has been wonderful—blue and gold every day, with good rains at night. Our lawn is very green now, and the monkshood makes a violet hedge against the gray house. It is so mild now, the weather, that we can sit out in our steamer chairs after dinner. The fire places have not been lit for a week. Mrs. Beal & Ralph are here cleaning house today, and I am now writing in the attic. We read the proofs of the new book last week. On Saturday we walked to Bright Angels, but no sweet twin did follow. We both miss you very much and often wish you were here. On Friday Miss Bromhall came for tea. She and Miss Jordan and Miss Glissing and many others wish to be remembered to you—they also miss you. You must both come here again, my dears, before you do any desperate thing like getting ⬩W⬩S⬩C⬩ married. If we all three wish it, we can make it come true. Next time it must be in August, when all the flowers are out, and the water warms enough to bathe in, and the whales due to arrive. The morning you left we got up early and waited on the shore, but we couldn't even see the boat. I wish your father and mother could have come on up [on an ] airplane and dropped down on us while you were here. Perhaps they can, next time, and we can go to the Wolves and out to Gunnet Light. Tomorrow we go to Southern Head if it is fine, and I shall remember the happy day we had there with you. A world of love to you, my dears. from your Aunt Willie"

Cather’s brother. Roscoe was born in Virginia, the second child and oldest son of Charles and Virginia Cather. After graduating from Red Cloud (NE) High School in 1895, he taught country school for two years, attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln for one year (1897-1898), taught high school in Carlton, NE, and Oxford, NE, and finally became superintendent of schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an abstract office and where their three children, Virginia and twins Margaret and Elizabeth, were born. In 1921, they moved to Casper, WY, where Roscoe became president of the Wyoming Trust Company, and in 1937 to Colusa, CA, where Roscoe and his brother Douglass had acquired a controlling interest in the First Savings Bank of Colusa. Roscoe served as president of the bank until his death. Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926 trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle family-related business as well as personal financial matters, and he was one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932).Edith Lewis in the 1920sCharles E. Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Lewis, Edith Labaree (1881-1972). Magazine editor, advertising copywriter, and Cather's domestic partner. Born in Lincoln, NE, to Henry Euclid Lewis and Lillie Gould Lewis, Edith Lewis attended the preparatory school associated with the University of Nebraska, earning college credits from the University before transferring to Smith College in Northampton, MA, in 1899. She received an A.B. in English from Smith in 1902 and returned home to teach elementary school. She met Willa Cather in the summer of 1903 at the home of Sarah Harris, publisher of the Lincoln Courier. Moving to New York City soon afterward, Lewis settled into a studio on Washington Square and found work at the Century Publishing Company. Cather was her guest when she visited the city from Pittsburgh. In 1906, at Cather's suggestion, Lewis applied for a position as an editorial proofreader at McClure's Magazine, and the two women worked together on the McClure's staff for six years. In 1908, they moved into a shared apartment at 82 Washington Place, and then, in 1912, to Five Bank Street. Lewis left McClure's in 1915 to become managing editor of Every Week Magazine, where she stayed until the magazine folded in 1918. In 1919 she began a long career as an advertising copywriter at the J. Walter Thompson Co. In 1926 Edith Lewis acquired the land on which she and Cather built their cottage on Grand Manan Island. When they lost their apartment on Bank Street to subway construction in 1927, they shared quarters at the Grosvenor Hotel when they were both in New York City. In 1932 they took an apartment at 570 Park Avenue. Throughout their relationship, Lewis was closely involved in Cather's creative process, reading and editing her work in pre-publication forms. Cather's will appointed Lewis as executor of her literary estate and a beneficiary of her literary trust. Lewis authorized E.K. Brown as Cather's first biographer and published her own memoir of Cather, Willa Cather Living (1953). She remained in their Park Avenue apartment after Cather's death and died there after a long period of illness and invalidism. She is buried at Cather's side in Jaffrey, NH.Jacobus, Sarah Hayes (1875-1948). Proprietor of the Whale Cove Inn, Grand Manan Island. An 1897 graduate of the Boston Normal School for Gymnastics, Sarah Jacobus \"discovered\" Grand Manan Island with two classmates in 1900, and in 1901 they purchased property at Whale Cove. By the time Willa Cather and Edith Lewis first visited Whale Cove in 1922, the summer colony had become an inn, with guests renting rooms in the main building or in adjacent cottages and taking meals in the inn's dining room. Jacobus was co-owner of the inn, and during the summer season she was in residence as the on-site manager. When summer visitors, including Cather and Lewis, built their own cottages, they continued to take meals in the dining room. In the off seasons from 1920 through 1932 Jacobus lived in Manhattan and worked in the Circulation Department of the New York Public Library. Later in her life, she lived year round on Grand Manan and died there.",

They married in 1916, and their son Alfred “Pat” Knopf was born in 1918. Cather chose him as her publisher beginning with Youth and the Bright Medusa (1920) and One of Ours (1922), partly because she was dissatisfied with the promotion of her books by Houghton Mifflin but also because she recognized the high quality of Knopf's books, as well as what she regarded as his intelligent advertising. Knopf was noted for publishing the work of leading European and South American writers in translation, as well as original works. Knopf and Cather’s extensive correspondence testifies to their mutual professional respect and to what also became an important personal friendship.",
          "text" : "⬩W⬩S⬩C⬩ February 19, 1942.My dear Mary: This must be a hurly-burly letter. The unanswered letters have piled up on my desk until I am nearly distracted. Please tell Carrie I cannot answer her dear letter until I have worked off a reply to some that have lain here for three weeks. I merely write this to explain some books I am sending you. When I was weeding out my bookcase for about a hundred books to send to the soldier camps I came across this book on Prague, sent me long ago when Bohemia had a consul generalship here. Many of the books I sent the soldiers were books presented to me with inscriptions, and I went through the lot tearing out the personal dedications. Just as I had torn the inscription from this one, I bethought me that either you or Carrie had been in Prague. I, alas, have never been there. I do not suppose the text of this book is very interesting, but on glancing through it I think some of the drawings are very interesting, and I am sure that whichever one of the Miner sisters has been in Prague will find the book entertaining. Several days ago I ordered from the Channel Book Shop one of the first copies of Sigrid Undset's book about her escape from Norway. I think the title most unfortunate (Why wouldn't she call it simply, \"My Escape From Norway\"?). But Frau Undset is one of the most absolutely truthful women I have ever known, so she is equally one of the most unpersuadable! But once you get past the title, I find the book absolutely thrilling. A good deal of her journey across Russia she told me last winter with many interesting details which she omits here, but they were all of the same kind. I don't know whether a whole people is willing to live in such degrading filth and poverty for an idea or whether, against their will, they⬩W⬩S⬩C⬩ are forced to live like pigs because the Government took everything for the army and munitions. Fru Undset doesn't know, either. She doesn't pretend to explain it in conversation. She simply tells what she saw. She really had a jolly time in spite of all the dirt, and was so amused by two nice Princeton boys who had the compartment next hers on the \"luxury\" train to Vladivostok. They had got on the train believing all the fairy tales that American Communists tell them about \"efficiency\" in Russia. She always shared with them her sticks of chocolate, and every morning gave them a little mug of her precious store of bottled water to brush their teeth with.! You see, she had started from Sweden well provisioned with bottled water, chocolate, dried fish, etc. All the food on the train was either spoiled or full of dirt. One thing you may be sure of, Undset never exaggerates anything. As I say, there are some details of the disgusting conditions she encountered in Russia which simply could not be printed in this country. I am afraid for her, that there will be an awful row because she tells how much she admired Japan and such natives as she saw. I am telling her that I fear the women's clubs of the U.S.A. will come back at her. But they could not make her take back a line of her story if they put the thumb screws on her. Alfred Knopf and I would have liked to make some suggestions and to persuade her about the title, but neither of us was bold enough to do so. When I urged him to make suggestions about the title, he chuckled and said: \"Fine! You try first.\" Affectionately Willie"

Cather’s mother. Born in the Virginia to William Lee Boak and Rachel Seibert Boak, Virginia was educated in Baltimore, MD, and was a schoolteacher until her marriage to Charles Fectigue Cather in 1872. Her husband’s family were primarily Union supporters during the Civil War while her family supported the Confederacy (three brothers served in the Confederate Army although their mother opposed slavery). After her marriage she tried to help unite the divided family. Four of her children, Willa, Roscoe, Charles Douglas, and Jessica Virginia, were born in Virginia, while three, Jessica Virginia, James Donald, Elsie Margaret, and John Esten, were born in Nebraska after the family moved there in 1883. Despite occasional differences, Cather remained in affectionate contact with her mother, who remained in Red Cloud, NE, where the family settled in 1884. After her husband’s death in 1928 Virginia Cather suffered a stroke while visiting her children and their families in California. She spent nearly three years in a sanitarium in Pasadena, CA, unable to speak. Willa Cather visited her there several times but was unable to travel quickly enough from Grand Manan to Red Cloud for her funeral and interment after she died in Pasadena in 1931. Virginia Cather was the prototype for Victoria Templeton in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932), which Willa Cather completed shortly before her mother’s death.Studio portrait of Mary Virginia Boak Cather around the year 1900Philip L. and Helen Cather Southwick Collections, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Mary Virginia Boak (1850-1931) (“Virginia” or “Jenny”).

Cather's niece. Born in Red Cloud, NE, to Jessica Cather Auld and James William Auld, Mary Virginia graduated from Red Cloud High School in 1924 and then spent a year at Dana Hall in Wellesley, MA, to qualify for admission to Smith College in Northampton, MA. In 1929 she received an A.B. in psychology from Smith and then moved to New York City, where she found work at Lord & Taylor before telling her aunt of her arrival. In 1930, probably with Willa Cather's help, she secured a position in the Circulation Department of the New York Public Library. In 1931, she entered the library's internal training school and in 1932 was assigned to the Tremont branch library in the Bronx. After Mary Virginia’s parents divorced in 1933 Cather took a quasi-parental role. She paid for vacations and when, in 1935, Mary Virginia married Richard (Dick) Mellen, a graduate of Harvard Medical School and roommate of her brother William Thomas Auld at Amherst College, she supervised wedding arrangements. After Dick was commissioned as a doctor in the Air Force, Mary Virginia—much to Cather’s regret—accompanied him to Chattanooga, TN, where he was assigned. In Cather's will, Mary Virginia was designated a beneficiary of the literary estate.Auld, Jessica Virginia Cather (1881-1964) (“Jessie”). Cather’s sister. Born in Virginia and raised in Red Cloud, NE, Jessica was the fourth child and second daughter of Charles and Virginia Cather. After graduating from Red Cloud High School in 1899, she taught at a country school and the South Side Grade School until her marriage to James William Auld, a Red Cloud banker, in 1904. They had three children (Charles, William Thomas, and Mary Virginia). After their divorce in 1933, she moved to Palo Alto, CA, where she died thirty-one years later. Few letters from Willa Cather to her sister Jessica survive, and particularly after Jessica’s divorce their relationship was strained.No annotation is availableNo annotation is availableSouthwick, Helen Louise Cather (1918-2004). Cather’s niece. Helen was born in Red Cloud, NE, to Willa Cather’s brother James and his wife Ethel. Willa was a doting aunt on her visits to Red Cloud. In 1931, Helen moved with her family to Long Beach, CA, where she graduated high school and attended Long Beach City College. In 1939, Helen returned to Red Cloud to help care for her maternal grandmother and then enrolled in the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, where she met her future husband, Philip Southwick. After graduating in 1941, she briefly returned to California to work in the personnel department of Douglas Aircraft company, but married Southwick in Lincoln in 1942, and then moved with him to Champagne, IL. When Philip’s employment took them to Plainfield, NJ, she frequently spent time with her aunt in New York City. In 1946, the Southwicks moved to Pittsburgh, PA, where their son James was born. In later years Helen worked as a school librarian and was active in the Cather Foundation in Red Cloud, NE. She was a beneficiary of Cather’s literary estate, and when Edith Lewis died in 1972 she bequeathed Cather books and manuscripts to Helen and her brother Charles Cather. Helen donated her share of these materials and Willa Cather’s letters to her to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.A studio portrait of Elsie Margaret Cather Philip L. and Helen Cather Southwick Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Elsie Margaret (1890-1964) (“Bobbie”). Cather’s sister. Born in Red Cloud, NE, shortly before Willa Cather graduated from high school, Elsie attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln from 1908 to 1910, before transferring to Smith College, in Northampton, MA, from which she graduated with an A.B. in English and Latin in 1912. She undertook graduate study at the University of Nebraska in 1914 and in 1916 received her A.M. with a major in philosophy and a minor in English. At both the undergraduate and the graduate level at Nebraska, she studied under Louise Pound. She began a career in high school teaching in 1912, when she took a position in Lander, WY, where her brother Roscoe then lived with his family. She also taught in Albuquerque, NM; Corning, IA; Cleveland, OH; and briefly Red Cloud, when illness in the family brought her home. Her longest tenure as a teacher was at Lincoln (NE) High School, where she began teaching in 1920, with Olivia Pound and Mariel Gere as colleagues. Willa Cather's expectation that Elsie be responsible for aging family and friends and for legal affairs after their parents' deaths sometimes brought the sisters into conflict. Elsie Cather retired from Lincoln High School in 1942. She died in Lincoln.Edith Lewis in the 1920sCharles E. Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Lewis, Edith Labaree (1881-1972). Magazine editor, advertising copywriter, and Cather's domestic partner. Born in Lincoln, NE, to Henry Euclid Lewis and Lillie Gould Lewis, Edith Lewis attended the preparatory school associated with the University of Nebraska, earning college credits from the University before transferring to Smith College in Northampton, MA, in 1899. She received an A.B. in English from Smith in 1902 and returned home to teach elementary school. She met Willa Cather in the summer of 1903 at the home of Sarah Harris, publisher of the Lincoln Courier. Moving to New York City soon afterward, Lewis settled into a studio on Washington Square and found work at the Century Publishing Company. Cather was her guest when she visited the city from Pittsburgh. In 1906, at Cather's suggestion, Lewis applied for a position as an editorial proofreader at McClure's Magazine, and the two women worked together on the McClure's staff for six years. In 1908, they moved into a shared apartment at 82 Washington Place, and then, in 1912, to Five Bank Street. Lewis left McClure's in 1915 to become managing editor of Every Week Magazine, where she stayed until the magazine folded in 1918. In 1919 she began a long career as an advertising copywriter at the J. Walter Thompson Co. In 1926 Edith Lewis acquired the land on which she and Cather built their cottage on Grand Manan Island. When they lost their apartment on Bank Street to subway construction in 1927, they shared quarters at the Grosvenor Hotel when they were both in New York City. In 1932 they took an apartment at 570 Park Avenue. Throughout their relationship, Lewis was closely involved in Cather's creative process, reading and editing her work in pre-publication forms. Cather's will appointed Lewis as executor of her literary estate and a beneficiary of her literary trust. Lewis authorized E.K. Brown as Cather's first biographer and published her own memoir of Cather, Willa Cather Living (1953). She remained in their Park Avenue apartment after Cather's death and died there after a long period of illness and invalidism. She is buried at Cather's side in Jaffrey, NH.Sherwood, Carrie Miner (1869-1971). Cather’s childhood friend. Carrie was the eldest daughter of James and Julia Miner, neighbors of the Cathers in Red Cloud, NE. Carrie was the prototype for Frances Harling in My Ántonia (1918). She was married to Red Cloud banker Walter Sherwood and was Willa Cather’s lifelong friend and correspondent.",
          "text" : "VIRTUS NON STEMMAThe Grosvenor35 FIFTH AVENUENew York June 22 Dearest Mother; I was royally treated at Yale, but of course got home very tired. Mary Virginia and her party sailed last night at midnight. She ran in to see me in the morning yesterday, looking very pretty in a pale green dress and hat, and very much excited about her first sea voyage. She is only allowed to take two suit cases [suitcases] for baggage, so she can't take a very large supply of dresses, especially as she has to carry Kotex and hot water bottles in her suit cases. The total cost of the trip is $750, and they will run over nearly all Europe, so that means that she won't travel in luxury, which is all the better. Jess and Tom and Charles are in town. I will try to call on them tomorrow, but that is all I can do as I am hurrying off to Quebec Tuesday night to get some facts for my stoy story. My English publisher is in town and I am so busy that I have had to call off my appointment with my dentist and will go away with a sore tooth. Wasn't that a dear little letter from Helen Louise, all about their plays and lemonade stand? I really love her letters, she never tries to show off and she tells what one wants to know. Tell Elsie I do thank her for the cretonne—Edith thinks it will be lovely for Grand Manan. I have sent my beautiful new Yale collar to Carrie Sherwood to keep in her spare closet. With my dearest love to you, darling mother. Willie"

American novelist; educational and social reformer. Dorothy Canfield and Willa Cather became friends in 1891 at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, where Canfield's father, James Canfield, had come to serve as Chancellor. The family moved to Columbus, OH, in 1895 when James Canfield assumed the presidency of Ohio State University, from which Dorothy graduated in 1899. She then followed her father to New York City, where he became Librarian of Columbia University, and she pursued graduate study in Romance Languages at the University of Paris and Columbia, from which she earned a Ph.D. in 1904. On Cather’s first trip to Europe, she spent time in France and England with Canfield, including an awkward visit to the home of poet A.E. Housman. Cather derived the central character of “The Profile” (1907) from Canfield’s friend Evelyn Osborne, whom Cather had met in Europe. Cather and Canfield became estranged for more than a decade because Canfield objected to the story’s planned inclusion in The Troll Garden (1905). Canfield married John Redwood Fisher in 1907, and their primary residence was Arlington, VT. Canfield Fisher had spent 1916-1918 in France engaging in war relief work, and Cather’s consultation with her about the accuracy of her depiction of wartime France in One of Ours (1922) led them to reconcile. In 1925 Canfield Fisher became a founding member of the Book of the Month Club selection committee. She published her novels (most of them very popular) under the name Dorothy Canfield but her various nonfiction works as Dorothy Canfield Fisher.Studio portrait of Mary Virginia Boak Cather around the year 1900Philip L. and Helen Cather Southwick Collections, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Mary Virginia Boak (1850-1931) (“Virginia” or “Jenny”).

I am so glad about it all, my dear, it's like a dream come true. I am journeying home slowly by the Great Lake route, about a thousand miles by water and a day at Mackinac. I will be in Lincoln with Mother next Sunday at 139 N 12th Street, wherever that is. Mother has been ill there a long time you know, and while I am not exactly alarmed about her, I am very much worried. So I don't see how I can get a visit in with you, much as I'd love to. Every minute in Lincoln must be with Mother. But at any rate I'll get to see you before you start East, and that's something. Until Sunday Faithfully Willa"

After serving as associate editor at the Atlantic Monthly from 1902 to 1907, Greenslet became literary editor at Houghton Mifflin in Boston, MA, where he championed Willa Cather’s early novels. As an author he specialized in biography. He was socially and professionally acquainted with Cather’s friends Annie Adams Fields and Sarah Orne Jewett, who may have introduced her to him in 1908. He became a director of Houghton Mifflin in 1919 and manager of the trade department in 1933. Greenslet and Cather’s correspondence provides many insights into Cather’s career.

Cather’s niece. Margaret and her twin sister Elizabeth were born in Lander, WY, to Roscoe and Meta Cather, and moved with the family to Casper, WY, in 1921. Elizabeth and Margaret both attended the University of Colorado, graduating in 1937, and visited Willa Cather and Edith Lewis on Grand Manan during the summers of 1936 and 1937. In Cather’s later letters to them, she often refers back to their summer visits as a magical time. Margaret moved to Colusa, CA, with her parents in 1937. After she married Richard Shannon in September 1938, she moved with him to Boston, MA, where he earned an MBA from Harvard University in Cambridge. In 1940 they moved to the New York City area, where their first child, Richard, was born in 1943. The Shannons moved to Washington, DC, in 1944, where their daughter Kathryne was born. Cather did not see Margaret again after she left New York, and Margaret’s other three children, Patricia, Margaret, and Elizabeth, were born after Cather’s death. Kathryne and Patricia became caretakers for a large family archive of letters preserved by their mother, which they donated to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln as the Roscoe and Meta Cather Collection.Studio portrait of Isabelle McClung HambourgPhilip L. and Helen Cather Southwick Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Hambourg, Isabelle McClung (1877-1938). Cather’s longtime friend. Cather met Isabelle McClung, the daughter of a socially prominent, Pittsburgh (PA) family, in 1899 in the dressing room of actress Lizzie Hudson Collier. McClung seems to have been the first woman to reciprocate Cather’s romantic affections. In 1901, McClung invited Cather to live in her family’s large home in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. She and Cather traveled together to Europe in 1902, and McClung accompanied Cather on a visit home to Nebraska in 1905. After Cather moved to New York City in 1906, she frequently visited McClung in Pittsburgh, finding the familiar house a congenial place to write, and McClung visited New York City, staying with Cather and Edith Lewis. Cather and McClung also rented a vacation cabin in Cherry Valley, NY, in 1911, and traveled together to Virginia in 1913. In late 1915, shortly after the death of her father, Judge Samuel McClung, Isabelle announced her intention to marry violinist Jan Hambourg. Cather reacted negatively to the marriage (which took place in 1916) but eventually reconciled herself to it, enjoying long visits with the Hambourgs in Toronto, Ontario, in 1921 and France in 1923 and 1935. Isabelle’s death in Italy from kidney disease, which came only four months after Cather’s brother Douglass died, left her feeling bereft. “No other living person cared as much about my work, through thirty-eight years,” she wrote her brother Roscoe (#2137). After Isabelle’s death, Jan sent to Cather the three hundred letters from Cather to Isabelle in his possession, and Cather destroyed them.",
          "text" : "FG Grand Manan July 24 Dear F. G.: When your letter came here I was taking a trip with two little nieces from Wyoming who have never seen salt water before. I am shocked to hear of your accident. A rock in the Connecticut river you say: fishing? But is there any fishing in that river? Perhaps your motor car plunged into the river—otherwise I can't see how you managed it. Anyhow I'm awfully sorry you had mischances. No, I don't think there will be another book for a year or two. I have one half-finished, but the long break of Mrs. Hambourg's illness and my stay abroad put it on the shelf. I lost interest in it, and shan't take it up until some turn of the wheel quickens my enthusiasm for it again. Sometime you must send me a volume of the size you have in mind for the set. My edition of the Thistle Stevenson (not autographed) seems to me just the right size book to hold comfortably. Surely you don't mean that I am to autograph each volume in this edition! You said something about an edition of twelve thousand sets, if I remember. Even twelve thousand autographs would be a pretty dreary job! Faithfully yours Willa Cather"

Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Lewis, Edith Labaree (1881-1972). Magazine editor, advertising copywriter, and Cather's domestic partner. Born in Lincoln, NE, to Henry Euclid Lewis and Lillie Gould Lewis, Edith Lewis attended the preparatory school associated with the University of Nebraska, earning college credits from the University before transferring to Smith College in Northampton, MA, in 1899. She received an A.B. in English from Smith in 1902 and returned home to teach elementary school. She met Willa Cather in the summer of 1903 at the home of Sarah Harris, publisher of the Lincoln Courier. Moving to New York City soon afterward, Lewis settled into a studio on Washington Square and found work at the Century Publishing Company. Cather was her guest when she visited the city from Pittsburgh. In 1906, at Cather's suggestion, Lewis applied for a position as an editorial proofreader at McClure's Magazine, and the two women worked together on the McClure's staff for six years. In 1908, they moved into a shared apartment at 82 Washington Place, and then, in 1912, to Five Bank Street. Lewis left McClure's in 1915 to become managing editor of Every Week Magazine, where she stayed until the magazine folded in 1918. In 1919 she began a long career as an advertising copywriter at the J. Walter Thompson Co. In 1926 Edith Lewis acquired the land on which she and Cather built their cottage on Grand Manan Island. When they lost their apartment on Bank Street to subway construction in 1927, they shared quarters at the Grosvenor Hotel when they were both in New York City. In 1932 they took an apartment at 570 Park Avenue. Throughout their relationship, Lewis was closely involved in Cather's creative process, reading and editing her work in pre-publication forms. Cather's will appointed Lewis as executor of her literary estate and a beneficiary of her literary trust. Lewis authorized E.K. Brown as Cather's first biographer and published her own memoir of Cather, Willa Cather Living (1953). She remained in their Park Avenue apartment after Cather's death and died there after a long period of illness and invalidism. She is buried at Cather's side in Jaffrey, NH.Studio portrait of Isabelle McClung HambourgPhilip L. and Helen Cather Southwick Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Hambourg, Isabelle McClung (1877-1938). Cather’s longtime friend. Cather met Isabelle McClung, the daughter of a socially prominent, Pittsburgh (PA) family, in 1899 in the dressing room of actress Lizzie Hudson Collier. McClung seems to have been the first woman to reciprocate Cather’s romantic affections. In 1901, McClung invited Cather to live in her family’s large home in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. She and Cather traveled together to Europe in 1902, and McClung accompanied Cather on a visit home to Nebraska in 1905. After Cather moved to New York City in 1906, she frequently visited McClung in Pittsburgh, finding the familiar house a congenial place to write, and McClung visited New York City, staying with Cather and Edith Lewis. Cather and McClung also rented a vacation cabin in Cherry Valley, NY, in 1911, and traveled together to Virginia in 1913. In late 1915, shortly after the death of her father, Judge Samuel McClung, Isabelle announced her intention to marry violinist Jan Hambourg. Cather reacted negatively to the marriage (which took place in 1916) but eventually reconciled herself to it, enjoying long visits with the Hambourgs in Toronto, Ontario, in 1921 and France in 1923 and 1935. Isabelle’s death in Italy from kidney disease, which came only four months after Cather’s brother Douglass died, left her feeling bereft. “No other living person cared as much about my work, through thirty-eight years,” she wrote her brother Roscoe (#2137). After Isabelle’s death, Jan sent to Cather the three hundred letters from Cather to Isabelle in his possession, and Cather destroyed them.Portrait of Jan Hambourg taken by Fizin in New YorkNebraska State Historical Society Hambourg, Jan (1882-1947). Russian-born violinist; Isabelle McClung’s husband. Hambourg moved with his family to Toronto, Ontario, in 1910, where he was the head of the violin department at the Hambourg Conservatory and performed as part of the Hambourg Trio. He married Isabelle McClung in April 1916. Cather reacted negatively to both Hambourg and the marriage, but she gradually came to accept him. Beginning in the 1920s, Hambourg left the family conservatory and focused on solo violin performance in Europe. Cather enjoying long visits with Isabelle and Jan in Toronto in 1921 and France in 1923 and 1935. She dedicated The Professor’s House (1925) to him (“For Jan, because he likes narrative”) and asked him to make musical corrections to Lucy Gayheart (1935). When Isabelle died, Jan sent to Cather the three hundred letters from Cather to Isabelle in his possession, and Cather destroyed them.",
          "text" : "August 12 Dearest Mother: I am writing from a small fishing village on the south coast of France, right on the Mediterranean sea. The last few weeks have been confused ones. Six weeks ago Edith Lewis went on to the south of Italy, and three weeks ago I left Paris and came south with Isabelle and her husband for an interesting but rather hard trip in the old cities of the South of France. We had just got nicely started when I fell ill and upset all our plans. The Hambourgs were so kind about having their trip spoiled, and came right down to this quiet, restful place on the sea where I would get better and where they could spend hours in the sea every day. Isabelle is a good swimmer and loves the water. Last week I was to have left Isabelle and Jan and gone on down to Italy to join Edith. But poor Edith writes that the food shortage in Italy has grown more serious every day. She cannot get enough to eat, no matter what she pays. She can never get enough bread, and can get no milk, butter, sugar, cakes or sweets of any kind! So now Edith will have to journey all the way back to France and we will all go to Paris together. Paris is the only place where one can still be as comfortable as before the war. I shall not go to Italy at all, but wilL sail from the north of France as soon as I can get a boat. It may be a month or six weeks before I can get a boat, as almost everyone is trying to get home now. I am tired of poor food myself, and I wish I could get into the kitchen at home and roast a chicken and make a pie! The food in Paris is delicious, but down here the country has not recovered from the war and provisions are scarce. Goodbye, darling mother. Isabelle sends you her best love. Willie P.S. Although I was the one who felt the worst, none of us have been very well down here. Isabelle is languid most of the time, too. I don't know why, for the climate is beautiful. Jan is a wonderful man to travel with—never cross about anything. I don't see how a man can be so patient!"

An 1897 graduate of the Boston Normal School for Gymnastics, Sarah Jacobus \"discovered\" Grand Manan Island with two classmates in 1900, and in 1901 they purchased property at Whale Cove. By the time Willa Cather and Edith Lewis first visited Whale Cove in 1922, the summer colony had become an inn, with guests renting rooms in the main building or in adjacent cottages and taking meals in the inn's dining room. Jacobus was co-owner of the inn, and during the summer season she was in residence as the on-site manager. When summer visitors, including Cather and Lewis, built their own cottages, they continued to take meals in the dining room. In the off seasons from 1920 through 1932 Jacobus lived in Manhattan and worked in the Circulation Department of the New York Public Library.

Tuesday My Darling Twinnies; Yesterday a wild northeaster—wish you could have seen it. Bitter cold, and breakers of black water pounding up on the Giants' Graves under a very low black–gray sky. Today, fair and dreanydreamy—all off on boat trips. I finished the autographs on Friday morning and sent them over to Eastport by special messenger (Ralph!) on Saturday boat. He bore himself like a King's messenger! Hadn't been to Eastport for years. We left the box in back hall, he came for it at six a.m. bore it off without waking us. Took it on boat as personal baggage, got it through American Customs, drove in a taxi to express office at the far end of Eastport, got it on the train for Boston. Such a proud man he was. Happy thought: if I take Ralph for my errand secretary, then perhaps we may have Willie for gardener? Willie went for Miss Jacobus to cut the alder thickets on the Dimple Downs with his double–edged ax. Ax rebounded from a dead alder and cut his knee to the bone. He walked home but was unable to work for some days—lost blood, of course, and such dirty clothes ribi rib rubbing it as he walked home! Inflammation gone, however, and the wound has healed. I was almost as much disappointed any as you, my dears, about your being shut out of the comfortable Frontenac. 3 I didn't realize that after prohibition it would be crowded. I should have written the Management two weeks before you went away, and demanded rooms as a personal favor. Ah, I wish you could see Quebec in Winter! I am sending a very interesting book on G. Manan on to Colusa. My hand is still stiff, as you can see—autographing didn't do it any good. I must get a note off to Stephen who cabled yesterday from Aix-les Bains to know where I am and whether I am ill. So now I must stop this letter. Everyone misses you, my dear children, but no one misses you so much as I do. Your very loving Aunt P. S. Oh delight! Yesterday Miss Bonnell telephoned Gannet Light keeper to ask if she might come to spend night first fair day. Keeper replied his wife away on visit for two weeks, and he was afraid Government Inspectors would not approve Bonnell's visit! These are the actual facts. She had engaged motor boat."

Cather’s sister. Born in Red Cloud, NE, shortly before Willa Cather graduated from high school, Elsie attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln from 1908 to 1910, before transferring to Smith College, in Northampton, MA, from which she graduated with an A.B. in English and Latin in 1912. She undertook graduate study at the University of Nebraska in 1914 and in 1916 received her A.M. with a major in philosophy and a minor in English. At both the undergraduate and the graduate level at Nebraska, she studied under Louise Pound.

Charles Cather was born in the Back Creek Valley of Virginia, north of Winchester. His family were sheep raisers who were largely, but not entirely, Union supporters during the Civil War. He married Mary Virginia Sibert Boak, daughter of Confederate supporters, in 1872. In 1883 he and his family followed his parents, William and Caroline Cather, and brother George to Webster County in Nebraska, where various cousins and uncles had also settled. Initially he ran a ranch in the county but soon moved his family into the town of Red Cloud, where he had an insurance and real estate business. Four of his children, Willa, Roscoe, Charles, and Jessica, were born in Virginia, while three, James, Elsie, and John, were born in Nebraska. Cather’s relationship with her father was very warm: she made regular visits to her parents in Red Cloud and especially enjoyed her father’s letters expressing appreciation of her novels. A week after she concluded a visit to her ailing father in Red Cloud, he died of heart disease. He served as the prototype for Hillary Templeton in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932).Studio portrait of Mary Virginia Boak Cather around the year 1900Philip L. and Helen Cather Southwick Collections, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Mary Virginia Boak (1850-1931) (“Virginia” or “Jenny”). Cather’s mother. Born in the Virginia to William Lee Boak and Rachel Seibert Boak, Virginia was educated in Baltimore, MD, and was a schoolteacher until her marriage to Charles Fectigue Cather in 1872. Her husband’s family were primarily Union supporters during the Civil War while her family supported the Confederacy (three brothers served in the Confederate Army although their mother opposed slavery). After her marriage she tried to help unite the divided family. Four of her children, Willa, Roscoe, Charles Douglas, and Jessica Virginia, were born in Virginia, while three, Jessica Virginia, James Donald, Elsie Margaret, and John Esten, were born in Nebraska after the family moved there in 1883. Despite occasional differences, Cather remained in affectionate contact with her mother, who remained in Red Cloud, NE, where the family settled in 1884. After her husband’s death in 1928 Virginia Cather suffered a stroke while visiting her children and their families in California. She spent nearly three years in a sanitarium in Pasadena, CA, unable to speak. Willa Cather visited her there several times but was unable to travel quickly enough from Grand Manan to Red Cloud for her funeral and interment after she died in Pasadena in 1931. Virginia Cather was the prototype for Victoria Templeton in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932), which Willa Cather completed shortly before her mother’s death.No annotation is availableEdith Lewis in the 1920sCharles E. Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Lewis, Edith Labaree (1881-1972). Magazine editor, advertising copywriter, and Cather's domestic partner. Born in Lincoln, NE, to Henry Euclid Lewis and Lillie Gould Lewis, Edith Lewis attended the preparatory school associated with the University of Nebraska, earning college credits from the University before transferring to Smith College in Northampton, MA, in 1899. She received an A.B. in English from Smith in 1902 and returned home to teach elementary school. She met Willa Cather in the summer of 1903 at the home of Sarah Harris, publisher of the Lincoln Courier. Moving to New York City soon afterward, Lewis settled into a studio on Washington Square and found work at the Century Publishing Company. Cather was her guest when she visited the city from Pittsburgh. In 1906, at Cather's suggestion, Lewis applied for a position as an editorial proofreader at McClure's Magazine, and the two women worked together on the McClure's staff for six years. In 1908, they moved into a shared apartment at 82 Washington Place, and then, in 1912, to Five Bank Street. Lewis left McClure's in 1915 to become managing editor of Every Week Magazine, where she stayed until the magazine folded in 1918. In 1919 she began a long career as an advertising copywriter at the J. Walter Thompson Co. In 1926 Edith Lewis acquired the land on which she and Cather built their cottage on Grand Manan Island. When they lost their apartment on Bank Street to subway construction in 1927, they shared quarters at the Grosvenor Hotel when they were both in New York City. In 1932 they took an apartment at 570 Park Avenue. Throughout their relationship, Lewis was closely involved in Cather's creative process, reading and editing her work in pre-publication forms. Cather's will appointed Lewis as executor of her literary estate and a beneficiary of her literary trust. Lewis authorized E.K. Brown as Cather's first biographer and published her own memoir of Cather, Willa Cather Living (1953). She remained in their Park Avenue apartment after Cather's death and died there after a long period of illness and invalidism. She is buried at Cather's side in Jaffrey, NH.Ferris, Mollie (c. 1864-1941). Cather family friend in Red Cloud. Ferris was a close friend of Cather’s mother. Willa Cather and Ferris served jointly as godmothers when Cather’s niece Helen Louise Cather was christened in Red Cloud, NE, in 1918. When Ferris died, Cather contributed money for a stained glass window in her honor in Grace Episcopal Church in Red Cloud.Huffman, Elizabeth M. “Lizzie” (1901- ). Worker for the Cather family. Elizabeth and Raymond K. Huffman married in 1921. She worked in the households of the Charles F. Cather and Bernard McNeny families before moving to Stratton, in Hitchcock County, NE, by 1930; her family included a son, Richard, born in 1922, and a daughter, Emma Arlene, born in 1924. By 1940 the family was living in Haxton, CO.",
          "text" : "⬩W⬩S⬩C⬩ Jaffrey,Nov. 3rdDear Sister; Now you must not write me when you are deadly tired. Send me a single sheet of paper from time to time and say on it \"I am not displeased, but busy.\" I will understand. If you are running a temperature every day, I think you ought to stop teaching and live a quiet life in your own home. (What can you be afraid of there? To me it seems full of peace and protection, as it was those last years for Father and Mother.) At least you ought to see a doctor and try to find out why you have a temperature. I am enclosing a prescription for a nerve tonic, which has seen me through many a tight place. I am never without it. It given me by a very celebrated doctor--he's J.P.Morgan's doctor, and he found that Edith had thyroid when no other doctor co could tell what was wrong with her. Do try this--if you can't take it every three hours, take it before breakfast, before dinner and at bedtime. Three times a day will help, though four four is better. I have sent Molly a check for twenty-five dollars for her Thanksgiving. I had a letter from poor little Lizzie begging to borrow just ten dollars! I was glad to send it; she was so really sweet to Mother always. Now try the tonic and have faith in it. Take it in about a small wine glass full of water. It will help you a lot. With much ever no love, my dear Willie I return to New York in four days from this date."

JAN 27 191929 330PM The Grosvenor35 FIFTH AVENUENew York VIRTUS NON STEMMAThe Grosvenor35 FIFTH AVENUENew York Monday My Darling Mother I cannot use the typewriter because Edith is asleep. I have been without any voice for several days—not the usual kind of cold. I don't cough, I am simply as hoarse as a crow and it hurts my throat to talk, so I don't talk. I expect you are talking more than I am just now. I seem 2to remember that you used to get just this kind of throat and lose your voice. Almost every one I know has inf influenza, but I have not. I am working very hard and see few people. I went out to tea with Myra Hess, at her rooms. As I could not talk any, she played the piano—which was better. Last night the faithful Donovan came for dinner—the first time I have seen him since Christmas. Sister Jessie, by the way, wrote me a lecture on diet by way of a Christmas greeting, and said at last you had a Doctor who would keep you on barley water for the rest of your life. I did not reply to this sermon. Silence is surely better. When I go out to see you I will stay at a hotel near you—I don't want to add to the housekeeping, and I can be with you just as much as if I were in the same house, and in that way I won't make any more work for Elsie. I can stay with you when Elsie and your nurse go out. I'm so glad you have a nice nurse and a nice doctor; that means a great deal when one is sick. Goodnight now, dear mother, I hope this will be a good night for you, with refreshing sleep and happy dreams. Very lovingly Willa"

Margaret and her twin sister Elizabeth were born in Lander, WY, to Roscoe and Meta Cather, and moved with the family to Casper, WY, in 1921. Elizabeth and Margaret both attended the University of Colorado, graduating in 1937, and visited Willa Cather and Edith Lewis on Grand Manan during the summers of 1936 and 1937. In Cather’s later letters to them, she often refers back to their summer visits as a magical time. Margaret moved to Colusa, CA, with her parents in 1937. After she married Richard Shannon in September 1938, she moved with him to Boston, MA, where he earned an MBA from Harvard University in Cambridge. In 1940 they moved to the New York City area, where their first child, Richard, was born in 1943. The Shannons moved to Washington, DC, in 1944, where their daughter Kathryne was born. Cather did not see Margaret again after she left New York, and Margaret’s other three children, Patricia, Margaret, and Elizabeth, were born after Cather’s death.

Cather's niece. Born in Red Cloud, NE, to Jessica Cather Auld and James William Auld, Mary Virginia graduated from Red Cloud High School in 1924 and then spent a year at Dana Hall in Wellesley, MA, to qualify for admission to Smith College in Northampton, MA. In 1929 she received an A.B. in psychology from Smith and then moved to New York City, where she found work at Lord & Taylor before telling her aunt of her arrival. In 1930, probably with Willa Cather's help, she secured a position in the Circulation Department of the New York Public Library. In 1931, she entered the library's internal training school and in 1932 was assigned to the Tremont branch library in the Bronx. After Mary Virginia’s parents divorced in 1933 Cather took a quasi-parental role. She paid for vacations and when, in 1935, Mary Virginia married Richard (Dick) Mellen, a graduate of Harvard Medical School and roommate of her brother William Thomas Auld at Amherst College, she supervised wedding arrangements. After Dick was commissioned as a doctor in the Air Force, Mary Virginia—much to Cather’s regret—accompanied him to Chattanooga, TN, where he was assigned. In Cather's will, Mary Virginia was designated a beneficiary of the literary estate.A studio portrait of Elsie Margaret Cather Philip L. and Helen Cather Southwick Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Elsie Margaret (1890-1964) (“Bobbie”). Cather’s sister. Born in Red Cloud, NE, shortly before Willa Cather graduated from high school, Elsie attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln from 1908 to 1910, before transferring to Smith College, in Northampton, MA, from which she graduated with an A.B. in English and Latin in 1912. She undertook graduate study at the University of Nebraska in 1914 and in 1916 received her A.M. with a major in philosophy and a minor in English. At both the undergraduate and the graduate level at Nebraska, she studied under Louise Pound. She began a career in high school teaching in 1912, when she took a position in Lander, WY, where her brother Roscoe then lived with his family. She also taught in Albuquerque, NM; Corning, IA; Cleveland, OH; and briefly Red Cloud, when illness in the family brought her home. Her longest tenure as a teacher was at Lincoln (NE) High School, where she began teaching in 1920, with Olivia Pound and Mariel Gere as colleagues. Willa Cather's expectation that Elsie be responsible for aging family and friends and for legal affairs after their parents' deaths sometimes brought the sisters into conflict. Elsie Cather retired from Lincoln High School in 1942. She died in Lincoln.Brockway, Virginia Cather (1912-1983) (“West Virginia”). Cather's niece. Born in Lander, WY, to Roscoe Cather and Meta Schaper Cather, Virginia graduated from Natrona County High School in Casper, WY, in 1929. She received an A.B. in English from Smith College in Northampton, MA, in 1933, the same year Willa Cather received an honorary doctorate there. In 1934, she enrolled in the University of Chicago School of Social Services and was, for a time, a social worker. She married John Hadley Brockway, a Navy officer, in 1936. They moved frequently until his retirement from the Navy. She had one child, son George. In letters, Willa Cather sometimes calls her \"West Virginia\" to distinguish her from her cousin Mary Virginia Auld because Virginia Cather's birthplace in Wyoming was farther west than Mary Virginia's in Nebraska.Edith Lewis in the 1920sCharles E. Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Lewis, Edith Labaree (1881-1972). Magazine editor, advertising copywriter, and Cather's domestic partner. Born in Lincoln, NE, to Henry Euclid Lewis and Lillie Gould Lewis, Edith Lewis attended the preparatory school associated with the University of Nebraska, earning college credits from the University before transferring to Smith College in Northampton, MA, in 1899. She received an A.B. in English from Smith in 1902 and returned home to teach elementary school. She met Willa Cather in the summer of 1903 at the home of Sarah Harris, publisher of the Lincoln Courier. Moving to New York City soon afterward, Lewis settled into a studio on Washington Square and found work at the Century Publishing Company. Cather was her guest when she visited the city from Pittsburgh. In 1906, at Cather's suggestion, Lewis applied for a position as an editorial proofreader at McClure's Magazine, and the two women worked together on the McClure's staff for six years. In 1908, they moved into a shared apartment at 82 Washington Place, and then, in 1912, to Five Bank Street. Lewis left McClure's in 1915 to become managing editor of Every Week Magazine, where she stayed until the magazine folded in 1918. In 1919 she began a long career as an advertising copywriter at the J. Walter Thompson Co. In 1926 Edith Lewis acquired the land on which she and Cather built their cottage on Grand Manan Island. When they lost their apartment on Bank Street to subway construction in 1927, they shared quarters at the Grosvenor Hotel when they were both in New York City. In 1932 they took an apartment at 570 Park Avenue. Throughout their relationship, Lewis was closely involved in Cather's creative process, reading and editing her work in pre-publication forms. Cather's will appointed Lewis as executor of her literary estate and a beneficiary of her literary trust. Lewis authorized E.K. Brown as Cather's first biographer and published her own memoir of Cather, Willa Cather Living (1953). She remained in their Park Avenue apartment after Cather's death and died there after a long period of illness and invalidism. She is buried at Cather's side in Jaffrey, NH.No annotation is available",

I held it until after Elsie's visit with you—she is inclined to be jealous of anything I do for M.V. I toldwrote Virginia you had promised not to announce your Virginia's wedding until she herself did, and you weren't \"holding out\" on her. (What a sentence! Which pronoun belongs to which Virginia!) Now, please, you must write to Edith and to me. You will find that the result of being popular and loved is that you have to spend most of your life writing letters! We had our Sunday dinner in our snug little home last night.

Cather’s brother. Roscoe was born in Virginia, the second child and oldest son of Charles and Virginia Cather. After graduating from Red Cloud (NE) High School in 1895, he taught country school for two years, attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln for one year (1897-1898), taught high school in Carlton, NE, and Oxford, NE, and finally became superintendent of schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an abstract office and where their three children, Virginia and twins Margaret and Elizabeth, were born.

Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926 trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle family-related business as well as personal financial matters, and he was one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932).Studio portrait of Meta Schaper Cather around the year 1900Roscoe and Meta Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Meta Schaper (1884-1973).

My darling Margaret: None of my Christmas cards (and there were a great many) pleased me as much as your dear little donkey. He is certainly an Italian donkey, but all the same he reminded me of New Mexico and our pleasant visit there together, along with your father and mother and Elizabeth. I have not written you, my dear, because I cannot write at all. I have scarcely time to get bored, because after I have given my hand hot water treatment for half an hour, morning and afternoon, and had a splendid masseuse from Dick's hospital work on it every other day and then give it the proper amount of treatment under the lamp, there isn't very much of the day left. Please remember that I think of you and Elizabeth very often when I am resting after these rather exhausting treatments, and it is pleasant to let my mind loaf along and bring back the bright days we spent at Grand Manan. More personal communication is difficult when I cannot write (not even a line) and you cannot telephone. But some day I will telegraph you and try to make a date. A Happy New Year to you, my dear.

Cather’s sister. Born in Red Cloud, NE, shortly before Willa Cather graduated from high school, Elsie attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln from 1908 to 1910, before transferring to Smith College, in Northampton, MA, from which she graduated with an A.B. in English and Latin in 1912. She undertook graduate study at the University of Nebraska in 1914 and in 1916 received her A.M. with a major in philosophy and a minor in English. At both the undergraduate and the graduate level at Nebraska, she studied under Louise Pound. She began a career in high school teaching in 1912, when she took a position in Lander, WY, where her brother Roscoe then lived with his family. She also taught in Albuquerque, NM; Corning, IA; Cleveland, OH; and briefly Red Cloud, when illness in the family brought her home. Her longest tenure as a teacher was at Lincoln (NE) High School, where she began teaching in 1920, with Olivia Pound and Mariel Gere as colleagues.

Elsie Cather retired from Lincoln High School in 1942. She died in Lincoln.Creighton, Mary S. Miner (1873-1968). Clubwoman; Cather’s friend from childhood. Born in Iowa, Mary Miner was the second daughter of James and Julia Miner, neighbors of the Cather family in Red Cloud, NE. Willa Cather later recalled that when she first moved into town with her family and enrolled in school in 1885, “Margie Miner was so jolly I wanted awfully to know her.” They became lifelong friends and correspondents, and Mary’s sisters Irene and Carrie were equally close to Cather. Mary Miner wed local physician E. A. Creighton in 1900 and lived the rest of her life in Red Cloud. She was the prototype for Julia Harling in My Ántonia (1918).Roscoe CatherRoscoe and Meta Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Roscoe (1877-1945) (“Ross”). Cather’s brother. Roscoe was born in Virginia, the second child and oldest son of Charles and Virginia Cather. After graduating from Red Cloud (NE) High School in 1895, he taught country school for two years, attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln for one year (1897-1898), taught high school in Carlton, NE, and Oxford, NE, and finally became superintendent of schools in Fullerton, NE. There he met fellow teacher Meta Schaper, whom he married in 1907. They relocated to Lander, WY, in 1909, where he opened an abstract office and where their three children, Virginia and twins Margaret and Elizabeth, were born. In 1921, they moved to Casper, WY, where Roscoe became president of the Wyoming Trust Company, and in 1937 to Colusa, CA, where Roscoe and his brother Douglass had acquired a controlling interest in the First Savings Bank of Colusa. Roscoe served as president of the bank until his death. Willa visited Roscoe and his family in Wyoming several times and shared important travel experiences with them, including a 1926 trip to New Mexico with Roscoe, Meta, and their children and a 1941 San Francisco vacation with Roscoe and Meta. She also relied on him to handle family-related business as well as personal financial matters, and he was one of her chief correspondents throughout her life. Roscoe served as a prototype for one of the twin brothers in the Templeton family in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932).No annotation is availableBourda, Joséphine Marie Bernardine Brun (1892-1959). Cather’s maid. Raised in Lourdes in the Pyrénées region of France, Joséphine’s father Jean-Marie Brun ran a restaurant. In 1909 she married Alphonse Bourda, and they had two children, Marie, born 1910, and Clémentine, born 1912. In 1913 Joséphine, Alphonse, and Joséphine’s father immigrated to the United States, leaving Marie and Clémentine behind with relatives. Alphonse and Joséphine’s third child, Jeanette, was born in New York City in late 1913. Soon after, Joséphine found work cooking and keeping house for Willa Cather and Edith Lewis in their Five Bank Street apartment. In 1919 the Bourda family was reunited in New York and Joséphine stopped working, but by late 1921, she was back working half days until 1925. She resumed working for Cather and Lewis in 1932 when they moved to a new apartment at 570 Park Avenue, but in 1935, she and her husband decided to return to France because of his failing health. Cather considered Joséphine a personal friend and praised her as “an artist in her way” (#0563). Cather and Bourda evidently corresponded after her return to France but their letters have not surfaced. She died in the village of Saint Pé de Bigorre.Edith Lewis in the 1920sCharles E. Cather Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Lewis, Edith Labaree (1881-1972). Magazine editor, advertising copywriter, and Cather's domestic partner. Born in Lincoln, NE, to Henry Euclid Lewis and Lillie Gould Lewis, Edith Lewis attended the preparatory school associated with the University of Nebraska, earning college credits from the University before transferring to Smith College in Northampton, MA, in 1899. She received an A.B. in English from Smith in 1902 and returned home to teach elementary school. She met Willa Cather in the summer of 1903 at the home of Sarah Harris, publisher of the Lincoln Courier. Moving to New York City soon afterward, Lewis settled into a studio on Washington Square and found work at the Century Publishing Company. Cather was her guest when she visited the city from Pittsburgh. In 1906, at Cather's suggestion, Lewis applied for a position as an editorial proofreader at McClure's Magazine, and the two women worked together on the McClure's staff for six years. In 1908, they moved into a shared apartment at 82 Washington Place, and then, in 1912, to Five Bank Street. Lewis left McClure's in 1915 to become managing editor of Every Week Magazine, where she stayed until the magazine folded in 1918. In 1919 she began a long career as an advertising copywriter at the J. Walter Thompson Co. In 1926 Edith Lewis acquired the land on which she and Cather built their cottage on Grand Manan Island. When they lost their apartment on Bank Street to subway construction in 1927, they shared quarters at the Grosvenor Hotel when they were both in New York City. In 1932 they took an apartment at 570 Park Avenue. Throughout their relationship, Lewis was closely involved in Cather's creative process, reading and editing her work in pre-publication forms. Cather's will appointed Lewis as executor of her literary estate and a beneficiary of her literary trust. Lewis authorized E.K. Brown as Cather's first biographer and published her own memoir of Cather, Willa Cather Living (1953). She remained in their Park Avenue apartment after Cather's death and died there after a long period of illness and invalidism. She is buried at Cather's side in Jaffrey, NH.",
          "text" : "Miss Elsie Cather 1030 South 52nd Street Lincoln Nebraska NEW YORK, N. Y. STA Y JUN 15 1935 1130 PM Sunday Dear Sister; No, I did not have a prayer book, and it was good of you to send me this lovely one. This year I was so fretted by my hurt wrist at Easter time that I was especially glad to have any sign that my family remembered me. I would have thanked you long before this, but writing has been impossible for me, as my wright [right] hand got so tired keeping me clean and dressed. My left hand is still in splints. I have electric treatments and massage for it every day. It is not nearly so painful as it was six weeks ago, but everyone seems to agree that a badly sprained tendon takes anywhere from six weeks to three months to recover. Besides massage and dia-thermy I have to keep my hand in hot water for an hour in the morning and half an hour at night, so I really have become a trained nurse with one patient! I am always on the way to a doctor or on the way from one. If anyone in Lincoln should ask about my arm, please say it is doing very well—I don't like sympathy except from real friends, you know. I've written to Mary Creighton just how my arm really is, so the house people know. Roscoe has been to Red Cloud for me to save what he can out of the wreck. I'll send you his letter someday, and a copy of his report on the investments Will Auld made for me; about half of them seem to be all right, the others pretty worthless. Someday I will be able to write you a real letter again. Josephine and Edith are very patient with my infirmities. Edith has to do up my hair, and Josephine puts on my corsets for me! Love to you, and many thanks for my Easter present, dear sister. Willie"

Cather’s mother. Born in the Virginia to William Lee Boak and Rachel Seibert Boak, Virginia was educated in Baltimore, MD, and was a schoolteacher until her marriage to Charles Fectigue Cather in 1872. Her husband’s family were primarily Union supporters during the Civil War while her family supported the Confederacy (three brothers served in the Confederate Army although their mother opposed slavery). After her marriage she tried to help unite the divided family. Four of her children, Willa, Roscoe, Charles Douglas, and Jessica Virginia, were born in Virginia, while three, Jessica Virginia, James Donald, Elsie Margaret, and John Esten, were born in Nebraska after the family moved there in 1883. Despite occasional differences, Cather remained in affectionate contact with her mother, who remained in Red Cloud, NE, where the family settled in 1884. After her husband’s death in 1928 Virginia Cather suffered a stroke while visiting her children and their families in California. She spent nearly three years in a sanitarium in Pasadena, CA, unable to speak. Willa Cather visited her there several times but was unable to travel quickly enough from Grand Manan to Red Cloud for her funeral and interment after she died in Pasadena in 1931. Virginia Cather was the prototype for Victoria Templeton in “Old Mrs. Harris” (1932), which Willa Cather completed shortly before her mother’s death.A studio portrait of Elsie Margaret Cather Philip L. and Helen Cather Southwick Collection, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries Cather, Elsie Margaret (1890-1964) (“Bobbie”).

After a successful career in Europe as a mezzo-soprano, she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1903, where she specialized in singing soprano roles in operas by Richard Wagner. Willa Cather first met Fremstad in 1913 while researching “Three American Singers,” an article for McClure’s Magazine in which Cather clearly prefers Fremstad as “the most interesting kind of American” over Geraldine Farrar and Louise Homer. Through 1916 Cather and Fremstad were in close and regular contact in person and through letters, although Cather’s letters to Fremstad have not been located and their friendship evidently cooled. Fremstad inspired many aspects of the story, personality, and career of Thea Kronborg, heroine of The Song of the Lark (1915), and she approved of the novel, although Cather did not want readers to identify the character too closely with her. Fremstad married and divorced twice. During the period Cather and Fremstad were in regular contact Fremstad lived as a couple with Mary Watkins (later Cushing) who, after Fremstad’s death, published a biography of her, The Rainbow Bridge (1954).No annotation is availableNo annotation is available",
          "text" : "THE CUNARD STEAM SHIP COMPANY LIMITED R.M.S. \"ROYAL GEORGE.\" May 27 My Dearest Mother and Elsie: A week today since we left land, and we land in three days more. I have never had such a restful, peaceful crossing before. The weather has been beautiful, cold but not too rough, and I have felt exceptionally well all the time. Edith is always seasick and has been miserable—had to stay in her cabin most of the time. I don’t see how she can be so patient. We left New York with our cabin full of fruit and flowers, six baskets of fruit in all and three boxes of flowers,—from both my publishers and from Madame Fremstad and other friends. I sent a lot of it the fruit down to the children in the steerage and gave one basket of it to Miss Pfeiffer, of Lincoln. As Edith can’t eat any fruit, I am not equal 3to it alone. I saved your letter and Elsie’s to open and read on the steamer. Yes, Elsie, the novelette in my room is the one Mencken bought for the “Smart Set.” It had to be cut and changed so for the magazine that I don’t see why they wanted it—I really think they wanted me to have the $450 they paid me for it to help me on my travels. They never pay anybody else more than $100 so they make good their faith with works which is more 4than most admirers do. I liked Miss Pfeiffer when I was a kid, and still like her, but that hard grind has surely worn her out. The Suffragettes don’t bother much—some of them are nice and some dreadful. But there are many nice English and French people on board. I do very little but eat and sleep and look at the sea and look at the water, and sometimes think about the new novel that will be so good or so bad. I’ve not many ideas about it, but I’ve a great deal of love and a good deal of faith. Goodbye now, dearest ones, I will write again from France. Willa"

          "text" : "⬩W⬩S⬩C⬩ July 31st My Dear Alfred; Because of the varying schedule of the one boat which is our only mail carrier, I got your letters of the 24th and 27th on the same day! First, regarding the Heinemann situation. I don't think their attitude very cordial or very promising, since they refuse to bind themselves to anything at all. I have made up my mind to let you go ahead with Cassell. I will have to write a letter to Evans, of course, and I will send you a copy of it. Meanwhile you may cable Salzberg to go ahead with Cassell, so far as I am concerned. The news you write me about the initial distribution of the new book is delightful, and is a great surprise to me. I still see in that book only a story to please the quiet and meditative few. As it has got beyond that circle, I can only conclude that you and Blanche, and your office, and the \"Archbishop\" of four years ago, all had a good deal to do with bringing this bashful volume out before the curtain. I think the review in the Atlantic will make up the minds of a great many people who think they are intelligent, but unguided would probably have passed this book over as a dull one. I have just finished the longest of the three stories I mean for the next volume, and have sent it down to my secretary to be typed. It will run about 23,000 words. We had spoken of \"Obscure Destinies\" as a title for that volume of three stories. Would you like \"Out West\" better? They are all western stories; one in Colorado, one in Kansas, one in Nebraska. Tell Blanche the things from Charles came when much needed—especially the garlic and tomato paste, which you can't get in Protestant Canada; and yesterday a[I] made a risotto that would make your mouth water. I can still get excellent champagne in St. John, Pol Roger 1919, that excellent year, which I couldn't get in Paris at all, nor anywhere but at Aix-les-Bains. This island is always beautiful and the weather has been so wild and dramatic that I cannot stay at a desk very long. The climate is everything else in God's world,—but is never hot or sticky. My love to you both, and my very deep gratitude to you and all your staff for the splendid way they have stood behind this book. It gives me a lighter heart for the books to come. Faithfully yours Willa Cather"
